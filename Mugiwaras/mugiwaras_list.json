Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. He is one of the few people in the world that carry the Will of D. \n\nLuffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him, starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors in the Grand Line; emerging victorious in a majority of these battles. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage have caused him to be labeled as a 'Dangerous Future Element', earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine Headquarters and even the World Government. Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press has labeled him the 'Fifth Emperor of the Sea', though many prominent figures consider this to be exaggerated. \n\nThese acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of B$ 1,500,000,000. Having had a bounty of B$ 300,000,000 prior to his arrival at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties over B$ 100,000,000 which was received from the situation in Alabasta, a group which would go on to be referred to as the 'Worst Generation', with the addition of a twelfth.",
